            ## Auto-generated PR

            This PR was automatically created because the generated test source files in `test/src/**/__generated__/` were out of sync.

            ### What happened?
            The `dumpGeneratedSource` task detected differences between the generated code in `build/generated/ksp/` and the dumped code in `test/src/**/__generated__/`.

            ### What to do?
            - **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Merge this PR to update the generated files
            - **Option 2**: Run `./gradlew :test:dumpGeneratedSource` locally and commit the changes

            ## ⚠️ Generated Test Source Files Out of Sync

            The generated test source files in `test/src/**/__generated__/` are not up to date.

            <details>
            <summary>What does this mean?</summary>

            The code generated by KSP doesn't match the dumped files in the repository. This can happen when:
            - KSP processor code was changed
            - Test source files were modified
            - Generated files were not updated after changes

            </details>

            <details>
            <summary>How to fix this?</summary>

            **Option 1: Merge the auto-dump PR** ✅
            An automatic PR has been created: #${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.pull-request-number }}
            Merge it to update the generated files.

            **Option 2: Update locally** 💻
            Run the following command and commit the changes:
            ```bash
            ./gradlew :test:dumpGeneratedSource
            git add test/src/commonMain/kotlin/me/tbsten/cream/test/*/__generated__/
            git commit -m "chore: Update generated test source files"
            ```
