# Generated Source Code

This directory contains KSP-generated source code that has been automatically copied by the `dumpGeneratedSource` Gradle task.

**⚠️ DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY MANUALLY**

These files are automatically generated and copied from:
- Source: `test/build/generated/ksp/metadata/commonMain/kotlin/me/tbsten/cream/test/generic/`
- Target: `test/src/commonMain/kotlin/me/tbsten/cream/test/generic/__generated__/`

## Purpose

This directory exists to make KSP-generated code visible in the source tree, helping developers understand what code is being automatically generated during the build process.

## File Extension

All Kotlin files (`.kt`) are copied with the `.kt.generated` extension to prevent IDE errors and compilation conflicts with the actual KSP-generated code in `build/generated/ksp/`.

## Updating Generated Code

To update the files in this directory:
1. Run: `./gradlew :test:dumpGeneratedSource`
2. The task will regenerate all files from the latest KSP output

## Generated by

Gradle task: `dumpGeneratedSource`
